## Client Usage

[Get the client binaries](https://wamiqurrehman.itch.io/multiplayer-fps)

Currently available for Windows and Linux, ~~for Mac you can export from the source~~.

You can type in the custom server IP and Port or just leave the default settings and hit join to join the official server.

## Server Usage

If you want to host your own dedicated server you can grab the [server.pck](https://wamiqurrehman.itch.io/multiplayer-fps) file and put it in your dedicated linux server along with [server version of godot engine](https://godotengine.org/download/server) with the same names.

Once files are on the linux server just run the server version of the engine by typing `./server.64`.

> Note that you have to make server.64 executable by running 'sudo chmod +x server.64'
